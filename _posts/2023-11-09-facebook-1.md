It's been a whole year since Meta laid off 11,000 people on November 9, 2022. The company has recovered, started hiring again, and life seems to have moved on for everyone. But for me, it feels like I'm still stuck in that difficult day. The decision to let people go was seen as necessary for Meta's survival, but for those affected, it was a heartbreaking event.

# Career Change

In 2020, it was my 6th year in the United States. After 2 unsuccessful attempts at the work visa lottery, I decided to pursue a master's degree in computer science, shifting from psychology to engineering. Over these 6 years, I had witnessed the challenges faced by international students and realized that my existing path was unsustainable. To thrive here, I needed to learn technical skills for more opportunities.

During 2020 to 2021, I spent my days preparing for technical interviews and worked on web development projects at night. Coming from a social science background, I had to invest extra time to catch up on the basics. During Christmas 2020, I spent a little over 70 bucks on Udemy courses, learning JavaScript, Spring, and MERN stack. My resume transformed from initially having only Matlab projects to several more respectable projects.

# A Questionable Moment

In February 2021, I started looking for internships with just 6 months of coding experience after my career change. Despite my lack of proficiency, I received several online assessment opportunities thanks to the favorable job market.

During one such assessment, I faced a coding problem I couldn't solve, so I sought help from a friend and passed it. Afterward, I felt it was a questionable move, and I looked down on myself. But I couldn't afford not to get this job. It was a huge temptation for me. At that time, I didn't fully trust God's sovereignty. I should have believed that if God intended to provide something, He would, and if He wanted to take it away, nothing could stop Him.

In September 2021, I began the job hunt for new grad positions because I was graduating in the next year. In our industry, new grad hiring usually happens a year before graduation, and I managed to secure interviews with some big companies.

God touched me, and I prayed for His help to maintain my integrity. I wanted to get an offer honorably and glorify Him in my work. But, was I capable of doing so? I wasn't sure, as the temptation to land a job was overwhelming. Only with a job could I have the chance to stay.
Often, we become aware of our weaknesses and sins only when they manifest, serving as a reminder that God encourages us to turn our gaze towards Him.

# A Dramatic Interview

In October 2021, something dramatic happened during an interview from Facebook. I had passed the first 3 rounds and was down to the final round. The last interviewer presented a seemingly simple problem. If I solved it, I would secure the offer.

Technical interviews in the computer field differ from traditional interviews; they have a question bank, but the questions are often modified to assess problem-solving skills. Astonishingly, the final question happened to be one of the top three on a coding platform I had been practicing with. I could have easily solved it with my eyes closed.

At that moment, I had to make a decision: pretend not to know the answer and secure the offer, or tell the truth. Initially, the interviewer had mentioned, "If you've seen the problem before, please let me know." If I disclosed that I had seen it before, he might change the question, and I couldn't guarantee I'd solve the new one. But if I kept silent, I wouldn't keep my promise to myself. The interviewer would never know, but I would, and so would God.

Eventually, I chose to be honest, even though I felt it might cost me the job. The interviewer changed the question, and I thought, "I'm going to die." The second problem was one I had solved just two days before, and I could remember it vividly. This time, I hesitated for 2 seconds only and told him that I’ve practiced it before.

Strangely, a sense of relaxation and relief washed over me, as if I had already aced the interview. The third question was finally unfamiliar but difficult, and I surprisingly solved it somehow.

The 50-minute interview felt like two hours. I had a strong feeling that this interview wasn't just a test of my algorithmic skills; it was a test of my faith. In those moments, I could sense the comforting presence of God, walking with me through the challenges.

When I looked back, I wonder if I had failed the last question, would I still be as grateful as I am now, or would I regret my "naivety"? Everyone makes their own choices based on their faith at the time and nobody should judge except God. When we go against God's law (which we often do), God doesn't retract His selection due to our momentary weaknesses. Instead, He requires us to acknowledge our sinful nature, repent, and bring us closer to Him through these experiences. What a graceful Lord we have!

# Work Visa Lottery

When I had received offers from both Amazon and Facebook, I was excited but torn. Both companies were willing to help me with the work visa lottery, but the chances of winning were approximately 30%. If I didn't win, I couldn't work legally, as I had already used my 3-years OPT after completing my first master's degree. So, I only had one option—win the work visa lottery to work legally, or else, the offer would be meaningless. Many people are unaware that the most challenging part for international students isn't finding a job but obtaining work authorization. Not all jobs generously offer sponsorship for work visas.

I was fortunate that both companies were willing to sponsor me. If both companies applied, my odds would double. However, I hesitated because it would mean potentially breaking one offer if both won, which wasn't ethical, especially considering that I would be utilizing their legal resources as well. Ultimately, I decided to apply through only one company.

I had a simple belief at the time—I wanted to see where the hardest road would take me.

# Disappointing Lottery Results

Not every time leads to a miracle. The 2022 work visa lottery was one of the harshest ever. When I saw the official statistics, I was too upset to eat for a day. As someone who applied with only one offer, my chances of winning were just 26.45%. Why were they lower than expected? Because 13% of people had two or more companies applying for them. For instance, there were individuals with 75 companies vying for their visas.

To what lengths will people go to get what they want? Those 75 offers weren't all genuine, and these individuals may have been in dire need of staying. However, they might not have considered how their self-interest could harm innocent people. Many people leave their home countries, invest years in education and job searching, all for the chance of winning a work visa, only to be defeated so easily.

I don't hate them. I dislike the system. The individuals who designed this lottery system knew that such injustices would occur, but they didn't do anything. It punishes honest people in secret. For a long time, the US was admired for its pursuit of fairness and justice, driven by a reverence for God. However, the administration of this system was the opposite.

A year later, H1B fraud is receiving unprecedented attention, and as the saying goes, "Justice may be delayed, but it won't be denied." What's denied is the transient, like a speck of dust. Destiny blew this least significant speck, myself, to the edge of the precipice.
